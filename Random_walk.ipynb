    "# Introduction\n",
    "Random processes are very common in physics. When dealing with large numbers of molecules, such as in gases, we donâ€™t describe the trajectory of every single particle ($10^{23}$ particles is too much to handle) but often use probabilities to determine the average behaviour. Here, we look at some illustrative examples of using random numbers in physical applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Random walks\n",
    "The random walk problem is a classic example which, despite its simplicity, describes very well the basic physical phenomenon of _diffusion_. Diffusion is a process where par- ticles which are initially concentrated in a region in space spread out with time. For example, a drop of ink in water will gradually spread to the whole volume of water, even if the water is perfectly still. This is because the individual molecules (both the ink and the water) (i) have random directions and speeds, which depend on the temperature, and (ii) also collide with each other. It turns out that these two ingredients can be modelled very easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The method \n",
    "We first look at a random walk in 1-D for a single particle. We start the particle off at the origin of the x-axis and assume that it moves unit distance in each time step (the molecular speed is thus 1 unit). At the end of each time step we set the direction to left or right with equal probability, mimicking the effect of collisions. You can easily write the python code, but for flexibility of later python coding, I show here how to define a function, called `walk(steps)`, which is passed a single number steps and returns a vector of that length, which contains all the positions of the random walk."
